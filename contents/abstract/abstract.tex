	The provision of mental health support in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is often hampered by a reactive model that struggles with scalability and timely intervention. This research addresses these challenges by proposing, designing, and implementing a novel \textbf{agentic AI framework} to enable a proactive, data-driven approach to student well-being. The framework’s core contribution is a multi-agent system, the \textbf{Safety Agent Suite}, which is orchestrated by LangGraph and powered by Google’s Gemini Large Language Model. This suite provides a robust architecture for real-time crisis detection, personalized coaching, and privacy-preserving analytics, all under human oversight.

	To validate the framework, a functional prototype was developed. The system's capability to deliver evidence-based support was demonstrated by implementing a \textbf{Support Coach Agent} that provides interventions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. Furthermore, to address the critical challenge of user engagement, a novel gamification system was integrated, utilizing \textbf{blockchain technology} to issue NFT achievement badges. The prototype's feasibility was confirmed through testing scenarios that validated the agentic workflows. The results indicate that this agentic framework presents a viable and focused solution for transforming university mental health services, with the integrated features demonstrating its potential for delivering effective and engaging support.
