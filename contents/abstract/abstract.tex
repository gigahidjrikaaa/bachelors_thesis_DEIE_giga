	The provision of mental health support in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is often hampered by a reactive model, limited scalability, and inefficient resource allocation. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a novel agentic AI framework designed to enable a proactive, data-driven approach to student well-being. The framework is comprised of three collaborative agents: an \textbf{Analytics Agent} for trend identification, an \textbf{Intervention Agent} for automated outreach, and a \textbf{Triage Agent} for efficient resource routing.

	We designed and implemented a functional prototype of this framework utilizing a hybrid architecture that combines a locally-hosted Large Language Model (LLM) managed by LangChain within a FastAPI backend, orchestrated by the n8n workflow automation platform. The prototype's feasibility was validated through three testing scenarios demonstrating its capability to autonomously generate insight reports, manage intervention workflows, and perform initial triage. The results indicate that this agentic framework presents a viable pathway for transforming university mental health services, offering significant potential to improve operational efficiency and enable proactive, evidence-based decision-making.
